            <h1>Licensing</h1>
            <p>This page outlines the requirements of the Appweb open source license and the options for
            a commercial license. Please note, this text only provides a guideline. You must consult the actual licenses
            for details of the governing terms.
            </p>
            <p>Appweb is provided under an open source license. This license is the GNU license governed by
            the provisions of the <a href="gpl.html">GPL</a> license. This GPL license should meet your needs if you work for 
            a non-profit or educational institution. The GPL can also work well for evaluation within your company.
            
            For commercial applications, we recommend a Commercial License. If you require a commercial license or
            commercial support for Appweb, please see <a href="#commercial">Commercial License</a> below or contact <a href=
            "http://embedthis.com">Embedthis Software</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have any further questions, please read the licensing FAQ or contact us at<br />

            <h2 class="section">Open Source License</h2>
            <p>The <a href="gpl.html">Appweb GPL license</a> is ideal for integrating with other GPL software, internal
            use, evaluation, and some cases of stand-alone use.</p><a id="standAlone"></a>
            <h3>Stand Alone Use</h3>
            <p>If you are using Appweb in a stand-alone manner as free-standing binaries, and are not integrating the
            Appweb source code or libraries with your software to create a derivative work, then the GPL license should
            be sufficient.</p><a id="gpl"></a>
            <h3>Use with Other GPL Software</h3>
            <p>If you are integrating Appweb source or libraries into your application and your software is 100% GPL or
            is licensed under an Open Source License that is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses">OSI</a>
            approved and acceptable to Embedthis Software, you may use the GPL with Embedthis products, and embed them
            in your applications or devices. You do not need any other agreement or license &mdash; the GPL is all you
            require.</p><a id="nonGpl"></a>
            <h3>Embedding with Non-GPL Software</h3>
            <p>If Appweb is embedded into your application, or your application is linked using static or dynamic
            linking with libraries containing any Appweb source code and you do not wish to publish your source code
            under under an Open Source License that is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses">OSI</a> approved
            and acceptable to Embedthis Software, and you wish to redistribute your application, then you will need a
            <a href="#commercial">commercial license</a>.</p><a id="download"></a>
            <h3>Appweb Download Package</h3>
            <p>With the Appweb download, you will receive binaries, source code, samples and documentation and you need
            not pay any license fees. However, you must abide by all the provisions of the GPL. If you intend to
            redistribute your software and link Appweb with your application, the GPL requires you to provide 
            documentation and all source code on a nondiscriminatory basis.
            If you do not wish to
            provide source code to your application, you must purchase a <a href="#commercial">commercial license</a>
            (see below for details).</p>
            <p>Note that under the GPL license, you may develop, evaluate, and embed Appweb in your
            application or product provided it is not redistributed, either internally or externally. You may copy and
            modify the source code provided all copies fall under the GPL license.</p>

            <h2><a id="commercial"></a>Commercial License</h2>
            <p>You will need a commercial license if your application is linked with Appweb, statically or dynamically, 
            and it is not provided to your customers under an approved open source license. You will also need a 
            commercial license if you wish to redistribute your application. A commercial license includes the added benefits
            of support services and priority notifications.
            
            In summary, there are several good reasons to purchase a commercial license:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You require the ability to redistribute your product including Appweb.</li>
                <li>You do not want to provide non-discriminatory access to the source code for your application.</li>
                <li>You need a warranty on Embedthis software (see license for details).</li>
                <li>You do not want to run the risk of your organization's software falling under the governing terms
                of the GPL.</li>
                <li>You need support services.</li>
                <li>You want priority notification of updates, upgrades, security issues and emergency patches.</li>
            </ul>

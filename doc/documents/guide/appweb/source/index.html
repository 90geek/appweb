            <h1>Working with the Appweb Source Code</h1>
            <p>Appweb releases are available as either a binary or source code distribution. It is your choice which
            distribution you choose, but the source code distribution has several advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can recompile Appweb to optimize it for your specific system environment.</li>
                <li>You can reconfigure Appweb via configuration options to select the specific
                feature set you require.</li>
                <li>You can minimize the memory footprint and decrease the securable surface area.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Building Appweb from Source</h2>
            <p>The Appweb source distribution contains all the required source files, headers, tools, and test framework
            to reconfigure, build, and verify Appweb. For details, see the <a href="building.html">building from
                source</a> instructions.</p>

            <h2>Porting the Source to a New Platform</h2>
            <p>Appweb currently runs on a wide variety of operating platforms including: FreeBSD, Linux, MAC OS X and
            Windows. If your system is not one of these, you may like to try porting Appweb to your system. See the
            detailed <a href="porting.html">porting instructions</a> for tips on this process.</p>
            <a id="get"></a>
            <h2>Accessing the Source Code</h2>
            <p>With each Appweb release, a complete source code snapshot is provided. You can get the latest source
            code from the <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/download.html">download</a> site or you can
            access the <a href="https://github.com/embedthis/appweb">source code repository</a>.</p>
            <a id="repository"></a>
            <h3>Source Repository</h3>
            <p>The Appweb source code is hosted in a Git repository. We provide open read-only access. Write
            access is available to regular contributing developers. To check out the source use this command:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
$ git clone http://github.com/embedthis/appweb
</pre>
            <p>You can also view the repository at <a
                href="https://github.com/embedthis/appweb">https://github.com/embedthis/appweb</a>. This is also a
            convenient way to get the source code. </p>
            <h3>Repository Branches</h3>
            The repository has three primary branches for development and release: master, lts and dev. 
            <h4>Master Branch</h4>
            <p>The master branch in the repository is used for released versions. The HEAD of the branch contains the 
            most recent release of the software. This branch is regarded as stable and ready for production use.</p>
            <h4>LTS Branch</h4>
            <p>The lts branch in the repository is used for the LTS release versions. 
            The HEAD of the branch contains the most recent LTS release of the software. 
            This branch is regarded as stable and ready for production use.</p>
            <h4>Dev Branch</h4>
            <p>The Dev branch in the repository is used for ongoing developement. New features and test fixes are pushed
            to this repository on a regular basis. It is not as bug-free as the Master branch and should not be used
            for production.</p>

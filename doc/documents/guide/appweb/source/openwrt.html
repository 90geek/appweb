            <h1>Appweb for the OpenWrt Platform</h1>
            <p><img src="../../../images/nslu2.jpg" class="wrapLeft shadow" alt="nslu2"/>This document 
            describes the process to build Appweb for the OpenWrt platform. For other platforms and generic build
            instructions, please read
            <a href="building.html">Building from Source Code</a>.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>OpenWrt is a Linux project to create downloadable replacement firmware for consumer communications and
            storage devices. It supports devices such as the Linksys WRT54G router and the Linksys NSLU2 storage
            device.</p>
            <p>The OpenWrt project provides a highly configurable environment with an active development forum. Most
            code in OpenWrt is based on a GPL license. For more information about OpenWrt, please consult: <a href=
            "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt">Wikipedia OpenWrt</a>, and <a href=
            "http://www.nslu2-linux.org/">NSLU2-Linux Home Page</a>.</p>
            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>You will need the following components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linux development system</li>
                <li>OpenWrt</li>
                <li>Appweb source package (this will be automatically downloaded by OpenWrt)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Download OpenWrt.
                    <pre>
svn checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk kamikaze
</pre>
                    <p>Please read <a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html#x1-390002">OpenWrt
                        Documentation</a> and <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource">Getting Source</a>
                    for full details.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Check out the package/appweb/Makefile.</p> 
                <pre>
cd packages
svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/appweb
cd ..
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Configure the OpenWrt Linux kernel. From the top OpenWrt directory run the menu configuration tool.
                    <pre>
make menuconfig
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Select Network and enable Appweb. You can either build Appweb into the base system or build it
                as a loadable and installable package. Select "*" to integrate into the base system or "M" to build a
                package.</li>
                <li>Build the OpenWrt Linux kernel.
<pre>make</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Flash the OpenWrt firmware to your device. This is highly device specific and you need to consult
                the OpenWrt and your device documentation. The new firmware can be found under the <em>bin</em>
                directory.</li>
                <li>If you build Appweb as a package, it will be built as <em>bin/packages/*/appweb*.ipk</em>. You will
                need to install on your target by logging onto your device using ssh and then typing:
                    <pre>
opkg install http://url_to_appweb_package"
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Once the firmware is loaded and Appweb installed, you can point your browser at the url:
                    <pre>
http://hostname:8000/appweb.html
</pre>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>The appweb source tree is built under the <em>build_dir/*/appweb*</em> directory. Appweb saves the
            OpenWrt configuration so that you can use make at any time inside the Appweb source tree. WARNING: If you
            modify the OpenWrt <em>package/appweb/Makefile</em>, OpenWrt will remove the Appweb source and re-download
            and extract the source code. So save any changes you make!</p>
            <p>The Appweb configuration for OpenWrt includes: Ejscript, Sqlite, Regular Expressions, Authentication,
            Directory Listings, HTTP client, ranged and chunked transfers, error logging and file upload. You can
            modify this configuration by editing the configure command in OpenWrt <em>packages/appweb/Makefile</em> and
            the run <em>make</em> or <em>make package/appweb/compile</em> if you are selected to build Appweb as a
            package.</p>

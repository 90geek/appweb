            <h1>Working with the Appweb Source Code</h1>
            <p>Appweb releases are available as either a binary or source code distribution. It is your choice which
            distribution you choose, but the source code distribution has several advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can recompile Appweb to optimize it for your specific system environment.</li>
                <li>You can reconfigure Appweb via configuration options to select the specific
                feature set you require.</li>
                <li>You can minimize the memory footprint and decrease the securable surface area.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <a id="building"></a>
            <h2>Building Appweb from Source</h2>
            <p>The Appweb source distribution contains all the required source files, headers, tools, and test framework
            to reconfigure, build, and verify Appweb. The software supports three tools for building from source. 
            <ul>
                <li>Make</li>
                <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/me/">MakeMe</a></li>
                <li>IDE project for Visual Studio or Xcode</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Building via <em>make</em> is the simplest and quickest way to build. Use <em>make</em> if you want 
            a default build or if you need to integrate Appweb with an existing make-based build system.
            Build with <a href="https://embedthis.com/me/">MakeMe</a> if you want to customize or configure the software 
            for your system, or if you need to cross-compile for another operating system or architecture. 
            Use the IDE projects for Visual Studio or Xcode if you are most comfortable with these tools and want 
            a default build.</p>
            <p>We use the MakeMe tool internally to generate the Makefiles, MakeMe and IDE projects. This cool tool
            generates clean, efficient makefiles and projects. The MakeMe project documents how to configure these
            generated Makefiles and projects on the MakeMe site. For full details, read on, courtesy of MakeMe:</p>

            <h2>Accessing the Source Code</h2>
            <p>With each Appweb release, a complete source code snapshot is provided. You can get the latest source
            code from the <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/download.html">download</a> site or you can
            access the <a href="https://github.com/embedthis/appweb">source code repository</a>.</p>

            <a id="repository"></a>
            <h3>Source Repository</h3>
            <p>The Appweb source code is hosted in a Git repository. We provide open read-only access. Write
            access is available to regular contributing developers. To check out the source use this command:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
$ git clone http://github.com/embedthis/appweb
</pre>
            <p>You can also view the repository at <a
                href="https://github.com/embedthis/appweb">https://github.com/embedthis/appweb</a>. This is also a
            convenient way to get the source code. Please use the <em>master</em> branch for the most recent stable 
            snapshot. For daily builds, use the <em>dev</em> branch.</p>

            <h2 class="section">Static Linking with ESP</h2>
            <p>If using ESP with static linking, you must take extra steps to pre-compile your ESP pages and applications.
            These steps are:
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-compile your ESP pages and applications.</li>
                <li>Link the ESP initializer code into appweb.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Pre-compile ESP</h3>
            <p>Use the following command to compile all ESP pages and applications that are defined in the appweb.conf file.
            <pre class="ui code segment">cd src/server
appesp --static --genlink slink.c compile</pre>
            <p>This will create a static library in the cache directory for each ESP application and in the 
                src/server/cache directory for stand-alone ESP pages.</p>

            <p>The <em>--genlink slink.c</em> option will generate the slink.c file which contains a 
            function <em>appwebStaticInitialize()</em> that will invoke the ESP initializers for the ESP pages 
            and applications. Appweb contains a reference to this function in 
            src/server/appweb.c. When rebuilt, it will then resolve and link with the ESP static libraries.</p>

            <p>Note that static linking implies significant limitations on Appweb:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modules cannot be dynamically loaded and must be statically linked</li>
                <li>Reloading ESP applications without restarting the server is not possible</li>
            </ul>

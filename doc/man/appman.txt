NAME
       appman - Appweb manager

SYNOPSIS
       appman [options] [program args]
              [--args arguments] [--console] [--daemon] [--heartBeat interval]
              [--home directory] [--install] [--log  logFile:level]  [--start]
              [--stop] [--uninstall]

DESCRIPTION
       The  appman program is the Appweb manager program. It starts appweb and
       then watches over it to restart it should it fail.   It  also  provides
       general management commands to enable, disable, start, and stop appweb.

OPTIONS
       --args arguments
              Arguments to use for the service program command  line  when  it
              starts.

       --console
              Windows specific option to allow the manager process to interact
              with the users desktop.

       --daemon
              Run the manager as a daemon process. This causes the manager  to
              detach from the current shell and run in the background.

       --heartBeat interval
              Windows  specific option to set the frequency in seconds for the
              manager to check on service.  This period should be short enough
              that  the  service will be quickly restarted should it fail, but
              not so short that the manager process consumes  significant  CPU
              resources.  If the service dies more than 30 times per hour, the
              manager will suspend restarting the service.

       --home directory
              Set the home directory in which to start the service.

       --install
              Windows specific option to install the manager as a windows ser-
              vice.

       --log logFile:level
              Specify  a  file  to  use  for  log messages. The level argument
              defines the message verbosity. Zero is the least and  9  is  the
              most verbose.

       --stop Windows specific option to stop the manager service.

       --start
              Windows specific option to start the manager service.

       -v     Output the product version number.

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       The <B>esp </B>command generates, manages and runs ESP web  applications.   It
       can generate ESP web applications, services, database tables, and scaf-
       folds.

       The esp command will create directories and generate configuration  and
       source code files that can then be manually edited as required.  Esp is
       intelligent and will not overwrite existing files, so  you  can  safely
       edit and regenerate without losing your changes. You can overwrite your
       changes if you wish to by using the <B>--overwrite </B>switch.

       Esp can run your application by invoking a configured web server.

<B>GENERATING APPLICATIONS</B>
       To start a new web application,  run  <B>esp  </B>to  create  the  application
       directory  and  generate  the  application  configuration and essential
       script files. For example:

             <B>esp generate app blog</B>

       This will will create a set of directories  which  have  the  following
       meaning:

             client         - Public client web content
             client/assets  - Images and assets
             client/css     - Client CSS and Less style sheets
             client/lib     - Client side Javascript libraries
             db             - Databases and scripts
             src            - Application source code

       Other directories will be created as needed:
             cache          - Cache directory for compiled content
             db/migrations  - Databases migration modules
             services       - Server side service controllers
             src            - Server side main source code

       Most  of  these  directories  are initially empty, but may be used over
       time. ESP follows conventions where specific  files  are  stored.  This
       greatly simplifies configuring a web application.

       Esp will also create some files which have the following meaning:

             app.config                - Appweb configuration file for hosting
            app
             appweb.config             - Stand-alone Appweb configuration file
             index.esp                 - Home web page
             start.bit                 - Bit build file

       The  esp command can generate various components by specifying the com-
       ponents on the command line.

             <B>esp generate app NAME components</B>

       The first component is the primary component and specifies the style of
       application  to  generate.  Supported styles are "angular" for an Angu-
       larjs client and "server" for  a  server-side  only  application.   The
       default is "angular".

       Other components are:

             SessionStore  - Client-side session state store for Angular
             LocalStore    - Client-side local file system store for Angular

<B>GENERATING MIGRATIONS</B>
       Migrations are generated code modules that manage portions of the data-
       base. Migrations are used to create tables, initialize with  test  data
       and  optionally  destroy tables. Migrations are typically generated and
       then hand-edited to  include  relevant  initialization  or  test  data.
       Migrations  are  useful  to  quickly  recreate  the  database  with the
       required tables and data.

             <B>esp generate migration DESCRIPTION TABLE [field:type ...]</B>

       The DESCRIPTION is used to name the migration which is created  in  the
       <B>db/migrations </B>directory. A migration is given a unique ordered sequence
       number and the description is appended to this number. The  description
       is  mapped  where spaces are changed to "_" characters. When migrations
       are run, they are run in sequence number order.

       If field:type values are supplied, the database migration will  include
       code to create a column for each specified field of the requested type.
       The valid database types are:  blob,  boolean,  date,  float,  integer,
       string, and text.

<B>GENERATING TABLES</B>
       To generate a database table without creating a migration:

             <B>esp generate table TABLE [field:type ...]</B>

<B>GENERATING SERVICES</B>
       Services are the primary mechanism for responding to client requests. A
       service is a server-side controller in the MVC paradigm. To generate  a
       service, run:

             <B>esp generate service NAME [actions...]</B>

       This will create a service of the requested name. It will create a ser-
       vice source file  in  the  <B>services  </B>directory.  If  action  names  are
       requested,  the  service  source  will define an action method for each
       name. You can edit the service source to meet your needs. It  will  not
       be overwritten unless you specify the --overwrite switch.

<B>GENERATING SCAFFOLDS</B>
       A scaffold is a generated service, database migration, client-side con-
       troller and set of views that provides add, edit and list functionality
       for  the  database  table.   Scaffolds  are  useful to quickly generate
       chunks of the application and prototype web pages and actions for  man-
       aging a database table.  To generate a scaffold:

             <B>esp generate scaffold TABLE [field:type ...]</B>

       This  will  create a scaffold for the specified database table and will
       generate a service of the same name.

       If field:type values are supplied, a database migration will be created
       with  code to create a column for each specified field of the requested
       type. The valid database types are: blob, boolean, date,  float,  inte-
       ger,  string,  and  text. The migration will use the name "create_scaf-
       fold_TABLE" and will be created under the <B>db/migrations </B>direcvtory.

       The scaffold will include an edit action and view  page  that  provides
       add and edit capability. The list action and view, provides the ability
       to list the table rows and select an entry to edit.

<B>COMPILING</B>
       Esp compiles services and ESP pages native code shared libraries. These
       are then loaded and run by ESP in response to incoming client requests.
       Code is compiled only once but can be run many times to service  incom-
       ing requests.

       In  development  mode, ESP will automatically compile the relevant por-
       tions of the application if the source code is modified. It can  intel-
       ligently recompile services and ESP pages. However, you can also expli-
       cilty recompile portions or the complete appliction via  the  esp  com-
       mand.

       Esp can recompile everything via:

             <B>esp compile ...</B>.

       This  will  re-compile  all  ESP  pages and MVC applications for routes
       defined in the appweb.conf file.

       Esp also provides options for you to individually compile services  and
       ESP pages. To recompile named pages or services:

             <B>esp compile path/*.esp...</B>.

            The  arguments  after  "compile"  are  pathname filters. These are
            resolved relative to the current directory.  Only  items  matching
            the filter pathnames are compiled.

       To  compile  the entire application and produce a single shared library
       file:

             <B>esp --flat compile </B>.

            If using this option, you need  to  specify  "flat=true"  on  your
            EspApp directive in the appweb.conf configuration file.

<B>CROSS-COMPILING</B>
       To  compile  for  a target system of a different architecture, you must
       specify the target.  To do this, use the -platform  switch  to  specify
       the  target architecture. Specify the path to the platform directory in
       the Appweb source code built for that platform.

            <B>esp -platform /home/dev/linux-arm-debug compile</B>

<B>RUNNING</B>
       To run your application:

             <B>esp run</B>

<B>CLEANING</B>
       To clean all generated module files:
             <B>esp clean</B>

<B>MIGRATIONS</B>
       Migration files can be run via the <B>esp migrate </B>command. With  no  other
       parameters,  the command will run all migrations that have not yet been
       applied to the database. You can also use <B>esp migrate forward </B>to  apply
       apply the next unapplied migration. Similarly <B>esp migrate backward </B>will
       reverse the last applied migration. You can also use <B>esp migrate NNN </B>to
       migrate  forward  or backward to a specific migration, where NNN is the
       migration sequence number at the start of the migration file name.

<B>COMMANDS</B>
       esp has the following command usage patterns:

             esp clean
             esp compile
             esp compile service name
             esp compile path/*.esp
             esp generate app name
             esp generate service name [action [, action] ...]
             esp generate scaffold model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp generate table name model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp run

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>--chdir dir</B>
             Change the current working directory before beginning processing.

       <B>--config configFile</B>
             Use the specified config file instead of appweb.conf

       <B>--database Database provider</B>
             Use  the  specified  database provider. Set to "mdb" or "sdb" for
             SQLite.

       <B>--flat</B>
             Compile the application flat into a single shared library file.

       <B>--genlink slink.c</B>
             Generate a static link initialization  file  for  ESP  pages  and
             applications.   This  is used with --static to generate a appweb-
             StaticInitialize() function that will invoke all  ESP  initializ-
             ers.    By   default,   appweb   expects   this   to  be  in  the
             src/server/slink.c file.

       <B>--keep</B>
             Keep intermediate source files in the cache directory. This over-
             rides the EspKeepSource setting in the appweb.conf file.

       <B>--listen [ip:]port</B>
             Define  the  listening  endpoint  address. This will be used when
             generating an application. The value will  be  patched  into  the
             generated appweb.conf configuration file.

       <B>--log logFile:level</B>
             Specify  a  file  to  log  messages.   The syntax is: <B>"--log log-</B>
             <B>Name[,moduleName][:logLevel]"</B>.  Level 3 will  trace  the  request
             and response headers.

       <B>--overwrite</B>
             Overwrite  existing  files.  Ejsweb  normally  will not overwrite
             existing files. This is to preserve user  changes  to  previously
             generated files.

       <B>--quiet</B>
             Suppress diagnostic trace to the console.

       <B>--platform [path/]os-arch-profile</B>
             Target platform configuration to build for and directory contain-
             ing appweb objects and libraries for the target platform.   If  a
             path is supplied, the specified platform directory is used.  Oth-
             erwise, esp searches from the current  directory  upwards  for  a
             parent platform directory.

       <B>--rebuild</B>
             Force  a  recompile  of all items when used with the compile com-
             mand.  When used with migrate, this will  recreate  the  database
             and apply all migrations.

       <B>--reverse</B>
             Reverse the application of migrations.

       <B>--routeName name</B>
             This  selects  the Appweb route by name that will be used for the
             ESP configuration. Routes can be given an explicit name  via  the
             "Name" appweb.conf directive. Otherwise routes are named by their
             route pattern.

       <B>--routePrefix prefix</B>
             This selects the Appweb route by prefix that will be used for the
             ESP configuration. Routes can be given an explicit prefix via the
             "Prefix" appweb.conf directive. If  the  route  prefix  does  not
             match,  the  first portion of the route pattern is tested against
             the requested prefix.

       <B>--static</B>
             Use static linking when building ESP components. This causes  esp
             to create archive libraries instead of shared libraries.

       <B>--verbose </B>or <B>-v</B>
             Run in verbose mode and trace actions to the console.

       <B>--why </B>or <B>-w</B>
             Explain why a resource was or was not compiled.

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       The  <B>esp  </B>command generates, manages and runs ESP web applications.  It
       can generate ESP web applications, controllers,  database  tables,  and
       scaffolds.

       The  esp command will create directories and generate configuration and
       source code files that can then be manually edited as required.  Esp is
       intelligent  and  will  not overwrite existing files, so you can safely
       edit and regenerate without losing your changes. You can overwrite your
       changes if you wish to by using the <B>--overwrite </B>switch.

       Esp can run your application by invoking a configured web server.

<B>GENERATING APPLICATIONS</B>
       To  start  a  new  web  application,  run <B>esp </B>to create the application
       directory and generate  the  application  configuration  and  essential
       script files. For example:

             <B>esp generate app blog</B>

       This  will  will  create  a set of directories which have the following
       meaning:

             controllers    - Controller source
             cache          - Cache directory for compiled content
             db             - Databases and scripts
             layouts        - Web page layout files
             views          - View source files
             static         - Static web directory
             static/images  - Public images
             static/js      - Client side JavaScripts
             static/themes  - Application HTML themes

       Most of these directories are initially empty, but  may  be  used  over
       time.  ESP  follows  conventions  where specific files are stored. This
       greatly simplifies configuring a web application.

       Esp will also create some files which have the following meaning:

             appweb.config             - Appweb configuration file
             app.config                - Appweb configuration file
             esp-app.h                 - Application header file
             layouts/default.esp       - Default layout web page
             static/layout.css         - Default layout CSS file
             static/themes/default.css - Default theme CSS file
             static/js/jquery.js       - jQuery client side script

<B>GENERATING CONTROLLERS</B>
       Controllers  are  the  primary  mechanism  for  responding  to   client
       requests. To generate a controller, run:

             <B>esp generate controller NAME [actions...]</B>

       This  will  create a controller of the requested name. It will create a
       controller source file in the <B>controllers </B>directory.  If  action  names
       are  requested,  the controller source will define an action method for
       each name. If not action names are requested, esp will define a default
       action  named  <B>index</B>.   You can edit the controller source to meet your
       needs.

<B>GENERATING TABLES</B>
       To generate a database table:

             <B>esp generate table NAME [field:type ...]</B>

       If field:type values are supplied, the database migration will  include
       code to create a column for each specified field of the requested type.
       The valid database types are:  blob,  boolean,  date,  float,  integer,
       string, and text.

<B>GENERATING SCAFFOLDS</B>
       A  scaffold is a generated controller, database table, and set of views
       that provides add, edit and list functionality for the database  table.
       Scaffolds  are useful to quickly generate chunks of the application and
       prototype web pages and actions for managing a database table.  To gen-
       erate a scaffold:

             <B>esp generate scaffold MODEL [field:type ...]</B>

       This  will  create a scaffold for the specified database table and will
       generate a controller of the same name.  If field:type values are  sup-
       plied,  the database migration will include code to create a column for
       each specified field of the requested type. The  valid  database  types
       are:  blob, boolean, date, float, integer, string, and text.  The scaf-
       fold will include an edit action and view that provides  add  and  edit
       capability.  The list action and view, provides the ability to list the
       database table rows and select an entry to edit.

<B>COMPILING</B>
       Esp compiles controllers and ESP pages native  code  shared  libraries.
       These  are  then  loaded  and run by ESP in response to incoming client
       requests. Code is compiled only once but can be run many times to  ser-
       vice incoming requests.

       In  development  mode, ESP will automatically compile the relevant por-
       tions of the application if the source code is modified. It can  intel-
       ligently  recompile  controllers  and  ESP pages. However, you can also
       explicilty recompile portions or the complete appliction.

       Esp can recompile everything via:
             <B>esp compile ...</B>.
       This will re-compile each controller and ESP page.

       Esp also provides options for you to individually  compile  controllers
       and ESP pages. To recompile named pages or controllers:

             <B>esp compile path/*.esp...</B>.

             <B>esp compile controller NAMES...</B>.

       To  compile  the entire application and produce a single shared library
       file:

             <B>esp --flat compile </B>.

<B>RUNNING</B>
       To run your application:

             <B>esp run</B>

<B>CLEANING</B>
       To clean all generated module files:

             <B>esp clean</B>

<B>COMMANDS</B>
       esp has the following command usage patterns:

             esp clean
             esp compile
             esp compile controller name
             esp compile path/*.esp
             esp generate app name
             esp generate controller name [action [, action] ...]
             esp generate scaffold model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp generate table name model [field:type [, field:type] ...]
             esp run

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>--chdir dir</B>
             Change the current working directory before beginning processing.

       <B>--config configFile</B>
             Use the specified config file instead of appweb.conf

       <B>--database Database provider</B>
             Use the specified database provider. Set to "mdb" or "sqlite".

       <B>--flat</B>
             Compile the application flat into a single shared library file.

       <B>--listen [ip:]port</B>
             Define  the  listening  endpoint  address. This will be used when
             generating an application. The value will  be  patched  into  the
             generated appweb.conf configuration file.

       <B>--log logFile:level</B>
             Specify  a  file  to  log  messages.   The syntax is: <B>"--log log-</B>
             <B>Name[,moduleName][:logLevel]"</B>.  Level 3 will  trace  the  request
             and response headers.

       <B>--overwrite</B>
             Overwrite  existing  files.  Ejsweb  normally  will not overwrite
             existing files. This is to preserve user  changes  to  previously
             generated files.

       <B>--quiet</B>
             Suppress diagnostic trace to the console.

       <B>--routeName name</B>
             This  selects  the Appweb route by name that will be used for the
             ESP configuration. The ESP directory names, and compilation  com-
             mands  are  determined  by  the  ESP configuration drawn from the
             specified route. The default is the first route with the ESP han-
             dler defined in appweb.conf.

       <B>--routePrefix prefix</B>
             This selects the Appweb route by prefix that will be used for the
             ESP configuration. The ESP directory names, and compilation  com-
             mands  are  determined  by  the  ESP configuration drawn from the
             specified route. The default is the first route with the ESP han-
             dler defined in appweb.conf.

       <B>--verbose </B>or <B>-v</B>
             Run in verbose mode and trace actions to the console.

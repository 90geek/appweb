.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBesp\fR command generates, manages and runs ESP web applications.
It can generate ESP web applications, services, database tables, and scaffolds.
.PP
The esp command will create directories and generate configuration and source code files that can then be manually 
edited as required.  Esp is intelligent and will not overwrite existing files, so you can safely edit 
and regenerate without losing your changes. You can overwrite your changes if you wish to by using 
the \fB--overwrite\fR switch.
.PP
Esp can run your application by invoking a configured web server.
.SH GENERATING APPLICATIONS
To start a new web application, run \fBesp\fR to create the application directory and generate the application
configuration and essential script files. For example:

.RS 5
 \fBesp generate app blog\fR
.RE
.PP
This will will create a set of directories which have the following meaning: 

.RS 5
 client         - Public client web content
 client/assets  - Images and assets
 client/css     - Client CSS and Less style sheets
 client/lib     - Client side Javascript libraries
 db             - Databases and scripts
 src            - Application source code
.RE
.PP
Other directories will be created as needed:
.RS 5
 cache          - Cache directory for compiled content
 db/migrations  - Databases migration modules
 services       - Server side service controllers
 src            - Server side main source code
.RE
.PP
Most of these directories are initially empty, but may be used over time. ESP follows conventions
where specific files are stored. This greatly simplifies configuring a web application.
.PP
Esp will also create some files which have the following meaning:
.RS 5

 app.config                - Appweb configuration file for hosting app 
 appweb.config             - Stand-alone Appweb configuration file
 index.esp                 - Home web page
 start.bit                 - Bit build file
.RE

The esp command can generate various components by specifying the components on the command line.

.RS 5
 \fBesp generate app NAME components\fR
.RE
.PP
The first component is the primary component and specifies the style of application to generate. 
Supported styles are "angular" for an Angularjs client and "server" for a server-side only application.
The default is "angular".
.PP
Other components are:

.RS 5
 SessionStore  - Client-side session state store for Angular
 LocalStore    - Client-side local file system store for Angular


.SH GENERATING MIGRATIONS
Migrations are generated code modules that manage portions of the database. Migrations are used to create tables, 
initialize with test data and optionally destroy tables. Migrations are typically generated and then hand-edited to 
include relevant initialization or test data. Migrations are useful to quickly recreate the database with the required
tables and data.
.RS 5

 \fBesp generate migration DESCRIPTION TABLE [field:type ...]\fR
.RE

The DESCRIPTION is used to name the migration which is created in the \fBdb/migrations\fR directory. A migration 
is given a unique ordered sequence number and the description is appended to this number. The description is mapped
where spaces are changed to "_" characters. When migrations are run, they are run in sequence number order.
.PP
If field:type values are supplied, the database migration will include code to create a column for each 
specified field of the requested type. The valid database types are: blob, boolean, date, float, integer, string, 
and text.

.SH GENERATING TABLES
To generate a database table without creating a migration:
.RS 5

 \fBesp generate table TABLE [field:type ...]\fR
.RE

.SH GENERATING SERVICES
Services are the primary mechanism for responding to client requests. A service is a server-side
controller in the MVC paradigm. To generate a service, 
run:
.RS 5

 \fBesp generate service NAME [actions...]\fR
.RE
.PP
This will create a service of the requested name. It will create a service source file in the \fBservices\fR
directory. If action names are requested, the service source will define an action method for each
name. You can edit the service source to meet your needs. It will not be overwritten unless you specify the
--overwrite switch.

.SH GENERATING SCAFFOLDS
.PP
A scaffold is a generated service, database migration, client-side controller and set of views that provides add, edit 
and list functionality for the database table.
Scaffolds are useful to quickly generate chunks of the application and prototype web pages and actions for 
managing a database table.
To generate a scaffold:
.RS 5

 \fBesp generate scaffold TABLE [field:type ...]\fR
.RE
.PP
This will create a scaffold for the specified database table and will generate a service of the same name.
.PP
If field:type values are supplied, a database migration will be created with code to create a column for each 
specified field of the requested type. The valid database types are: blob, boolean, date, float, integer, string,
and text. The migration will use the name "create_scaffold_TABLE" and will be created under 
the \fBdb/migrations\fR direcvtory.
.PP
The scaffold will include an edit action and view page that provides add and edit capability. The list action and view, 
provides the ability to list the table rows and select an entry to edit.
.PP

.SH COMPILING
Esp compiles services and ESP pages native code shared libraries. These are then loaded and
run by ESP in response to incoming client requests. Code is compiled only once but can be run many times to
service incoming requests.
.PP
In development mode, ESP will automatically compile the relevant portions of the application if the source code
is modified. It can intelligently recompile services and ESP pages. However, you can also explicilty recompile 
portions or the complete appliction via the esp command.
.PP
Esp can recompile everything via:

.RS 5
 \fBesp compile ...\fR.
.RE

This will re-compile all ESP pages and MVC applications for routes defined in the appweb.conf file.
.PP
Esp also provides options for you to individually compile services and ESP pages. To recompile named pages or services:
.RS 5

 \fBesp compile path/*.esp...\fR.

The arguments after "compile" are pathname filters. These are resolved relative to the current directory. Only items
matching the filter pathnames are compiled.

.RE
.PP
To compile the entire application and produce a single shared library file:
.RS 5

 \fBesp --flat compile \fR.

If using this option, you need to specify "flat=true" on your EspApp directive in the appweb.conf configuration file.

.SH CROSS-COMPILING
To compile for a target system of a different architecture, you must specify the target. 
To do this, use the -platform switch to specify the target architecture. Specify the path to the platform directory
in the Appweb source code built for that platform.

.RS 5
\fbesp -platform /home/dev/linux-arm-debug compile
.RE

.SH RUNNING
.PP
To run your application:
.RS 5

 \fBesp run\fR
.SH CLEANING
To clean all generated module files:
.RS 5
 \fBesp clean\fR
.RE

.SH MIGRATIONS
Migration files can be run via the \fBesp migrate\fR command. With no other parameters, the command will run
all migrations that have not yet been applied to the database. You can also use \fBesp migrate forward\fR to
apply apply the next unapplied migration. Similarly \fBesp migrate backward\fR will reverse the last applied
migration. You can also use \fBesp migrate NNN\fR to migrate forward or backward to a specific migration, where NNN
is the migration sequence number at the start of the migration file name.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 6
\fB\--chdir dir\fR
Change the current working directory before beginning processing.
.TP 6
\fB\--config configFile\fR
Use the specified config file instead of appweb.conf
.TP 6
\fB\--database Database provider\fR
Use the specified database provider. Set to "mdb" or "sdb" for SQLite.
.TP 6
\fB\--flat\fR
Compile the application flat into a single shared library file.
.TP 6
\fB\--genlink slink.c\fR
Generate a static link initialization file for ESP pages and applications. 
This is used with --static to generate a appwebStaticInitialize() function that will invoke all ESP initializers.
By default, appweb expects this to be in the src/server/slink.c file.
.TP 6
\fB\--keep\fR
Keep intermediate source files in the cache directory. This overrides the 
EspKeepSource setting in the appweb.conf file.
.TP 6
\fB\--listen [ip:]port\fR
Define the listening endpoint address. This will be used when generating an application. The value
will be patched into the generated appweb.conf configuration file.
.TP 6
\fB\--log logFile:level\fR
Specify a file to log messages.  The syntax is: \fB"--log logName[,moduleName][:logLevel]"\fR.             
Level 3 will trace the request and response headers. 
.TP 6
\fB\--overwrite\fR
Overwrite existing files. Ejsweb normally will not overwrite existing files. This is to preserve user changes to 
previously generated files.
.TP 6
\fB\--quiet\fR
Suppress diagnostic trace to the console.
.TP 6
\fB\--platform [path/]os-arch-profile\fR
Target platform configuration to build for and directory containing appweb objects and libraries for the target platform. 
If a path is supplied, the specified platform directory is used.  Otherwise, esp searches from the current directory 
upwards for a parent platform directory.
.TP 6
\fB\--rebuild\fR
Force a recompile of all items when used with the compile command. 
When used with migrate, this will recreate the database and apply all migrations.
.TP 6
\fB\--reverse\fR
Reverse the application of migrations.
.TP 6
\fB\--routeName name\fR
This selects the Appweb route by name that will be used for the ESP configuration. The ESP directory names, 
and compilation commands are determined by the ESP configuration drawn from the specified route. The default is the
first route with the ESP handler defined in appweb.conf.
.TP 6
\fB\--routePrefix prefix\fR
This selects the Appweb route by prefix that will be used for the ESP configuration. The ESP directory names, 
and compilation commands are determined by the ESP configuration drawn from the specified route. The default is the
first route with the ESP handler defined in appweb.conf.
.TP 6
\fB\--static\fR
Use static linking when building ESP components. This causes esp to create archive libraries instead of shared libraries.
.TP 6
\fB\--verbose\fR or \fB\-v\fR
Run in verbose mode and trace actions to the console.
.TP 6
\fB\--why\fR or \fB\-w\fR
Explain why a resource was or was not compiled.

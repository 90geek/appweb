.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\--args arguments\fR
Arguments to use for the service program command line when it starts.
.TP
\fB\--console\fR
Windows specific option to allow the manager process to interact with the users desktop.
.TP
\fB\--daemon\fR
Run the manager as a daemon process. This causes the manager to detach from the current shell and run in the background.
.TP
\fB\--heartBeat interval\fR
Windows specific option to set the frequency in seconds for the manager to check on service. 
This period should be short enough that the service will
be quickly restarted should it fail, but not so short that the manager process consumes significant CPU resources.
If the service dies more than 30 times per hour, the manager will suspend restarting the service.

\fB\--home directory\fR
Set the home directory in which to start the service.
.TP
\fB\--install\fR
Windows specific option to install the manager as a windows service.

Specify a file to use for log messages. The level argument defines the message verbosity. Zero is the least and 9 is the 
most verbose.

              [--args arguments] [--console] [--daemon] [--heartBeat interval]

DESCRIPTION
       The  angel  program  is a guardian angel for another program. It starts
       the designated program and then watches over it to restart it should it
       fail.  The  angel is a robust, minimal program with one job - to ensure
       the service remains available.

OPTIONS
       --args arguments
              Arguments to use for the service program command  line  when  it
              starts.

       --console
              Windows  specific  option to allow the Angel process to interact
              with the users desktop.

       --daemon
              Run the Angel as a daemon process.  This  causes  the  Angel  to
              detach from the current shell and run in the background.

       --heartBeat interval
              Set  the frequency in seconds for the Angel to check on service.
              This period should be short enough  that  the  service  will  be
              quickly  restarted  should  it  fail,  but not so short that the
              Angel process consumes significant CPU resources.  If  the  ser-
              vice  dies  more  than 30 times per hour, the Angel will suspend
              restarting the service.

       --home directory
              Set the home directory in which to start the service.

       --install
              Windows specific option to install the Angel as a  windows  ser-
              vice.

       --l logFile:level
              Specify  a  file  to  use  for  log messages. The level argument
              defines the message verbosity. Zero is the least and  9  is  the
              most verbose.

       --stop Windows specific option to stop the Angel service.

       --start
              Windows specific option to start the Angel service.

       --uninstall
              Windows specific option to uninstall the Angel as a windows ser-
              vice.

       -v     Output the product version number.

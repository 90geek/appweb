<B>NAME</B>
       appman - Appweb manager

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
       <B>appman [options] [program args]</B>
              [<I>--args arguments</I>] [<I>--console</I>] [<I>--daemon</I>] [<I>--heartBeat interval</I>]
              [<I>--home directory</I>] [<I>--install</I>] [<I>--log  logFile:level</I>]  [<I>--start</I>]
              [<I>--stop</I>] [<I>--uninstall</I>]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       The  appman program is the Appweb manager program. It starts appweb and
       then watches over it to restart it should it fail.   It  also  provides
       general management commands to enable, disable, start, and stop appweb.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>--args arguments</B>
              Arguments to use for the service program command  line  when  it
              starts.

       <B>--console</B>
              Windows specific option to allow the manager process to interact
              with the users desktop.

       <B>--daemon</B>
              Run the manager as a daemon process. This causes the manager  to
              detach from the current shell and run in the background.

       <B>--heartBeat interval</B>
              Windows  specific option to set the frequency in seconds for the
              manager to check on service.  This period should be short enough
              that  the  service will be quickly restarted should it fail, but
              not so short that the manager process consumes  significant  CPU
              resources.  If the service dies more than 30 times per hour, the
              manager will suspend restarting the service.

       <B>--home directory</B>
              Set the home directory in which to start the service.

       <B>--install</B>
              Windows specific option to install the manager as a windows ser-
              vice.

       <B>--log logFile:level</B>
              Specify  a  file  to  use  for  log messages. The level argument
              defines the message verbosity. Zero is the least and  9  is  the
              most verbose.

       <B>--stop </B>Windows specific option to stop the manager service.

       <B>--start</B>
              Windows specific option to start the manager service.

       <B>-v     </B>Output the product version number.

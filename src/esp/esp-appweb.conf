#   appweb.conf -- Appweb Configuration for use by "esp run"
#   
#   This configuration file controls the operation of the Appweb server. The 
#   order of configuration directives matters as this file is parsed only once.
#   You must put the server root and error log definitions first to ensure 
#   configuration errors are logged.

#
#   Define the logging configuration first so any errors are logged.
#   This is for errors and debug trace. This log file is for the whole
#   server including virtual hosts. 
#
ErrorLog "error.log" size=10MB level=2 backup=5 append anew stamp=1hr

#
#   Control the tracing of request and response requests to the error log.
#   This directive defines the levels at which various events are logged.

#   Log tx first=3 headers=3 body=5 limits=5 time=6 size=10K exclude="jpg,gif,png,ico,css,js"

#
#   Configure the access log.

#
#   Server current directory for Appweb to find necessary files and libraries. 
#   Appweb will change directory to this location when it runs.
#
ServerRoot "."

#
#   Create a "chroot jail" by changing the system root directory to this directory. 
#   Once changed files outside the jail will be inaccessible.
#   If rotating log files, must do Chroot before defining logs.
#
#   Chroot "."

#
#   Bind Appweb to listen for incoming requests on this address. Formats 
#   include (IP, IP:PORT, PORT). If an IP address is omitted, Appweb will 
#   listen on all interfaces. If a port is omitted, then port 80 is used.
#   Use [::]:port for IPv6 to bind to all addresses. [::1] is the IPv6 loopback.
#
Listen 4000

#
#   Name of the server to use for redirects and error responses to clients. 
#   Uncomment this line and replace it with the public name of your server. 
#   This host name and port do not get used for listening on sockets. If 
#   unspecified, Appweb will use the IP address for the host name.
#
#   ServerName http://example.com

#
#   Location for documents for the primary server host. Routes and virtual
#   hosts may define their own document root.
#
DocumentRoot "web"

#
#   Default directory index to serve when a directory is requested.
#
DirectoryIndex index.html

#
#   Location of the mime translation file to map content types to file 
#   extensions. For other types, you can use AddType.  
#   "AddType application/x-appweb-other other"
#
#   TypesConfig mime.types

#
#   Search path for dynamically loadable modules. If modules have been 
#   statically linked into Appweb, this directive and LoadModule directives
#   will be ignored. This directive must be before any LoadModule directives.
#
#   LoadModulePath "../../out/lib"

#
#   Notes on the request processing pipeline. The pipeline consists of a set 
#   of stages comprised of a handler, possible filters and one network 
#   connector. 
#
#   The request processing pipeline can be configured at various levels: 
#   globally, virtual hosts and location blocks. At each level, a set of 
#   processing stages can be defined. Inner levels inherit the pipeline from 
#   the outer levels. The pipeline can be reset at a level by using 
#   ResetPipeline. Each stage may be defined for all requests or only for a 
#   specific file extension or location path prefix.
#
#   If you use the AddConnector, AddFilter or AddHandler directives, the 
#   stage is defined for both input and output processing. For filters you can
#   use AddInputFilter AddOutputFilter directives to define for a single 
#   direction.
#
#   Multiple handlers can be defined, but only the first matching handler will
#   be activated when a request is processed.
#
SetConnector netConnector
AddOutputFilter rangeFilter
AddOutputFilter chunkFilter

#
#   Enable the uploadFilter if you want Appweb to transparently accept upload
#   data. Handlers receive form variables that refer to the uploaded file. 
#   Most PHP apps require the uploadFilter to be disabled.
#   SECURITY NOTE: Check the LimitUpload to cap the maximum upload. 
#   SECURITY NOTE: Always use the upload filter inside a route.
#
#   <Route /upload-uri>
#       AddInputFilter uploadFilter
#       UploadDir /tmp
#       UploadAutoDelete on
#   </Route>

#
#   Select the fileHandler for static files and as a catch-all when all other handlers fail.

#   Maximum number of worker threads in the Appweb worker pool. Must have at

#   will automatically adjust the number of workers between the minimum 
#   specified by the StartWorkers and the maximum specified here. Every ten 
#   minutes, Appweb will prune workers that have been idle for five minutes. 
#   Appweb has two non-worker threads: one for the master event loop and one 
#   for the garbage collector. So the total number of Appweb threads will be 
#   two plus the number of active workers.

#   Cache static content at the client
#   This sets an cache expiry period (secs) for content. Clients will refresh only if

#
#   Cache specific URIs at the server with a lifespan of one hour
#   All requests with the same URI path, regardless of request params are cached as one.
